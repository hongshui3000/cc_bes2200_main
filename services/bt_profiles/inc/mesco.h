 * SCO Manager (SCO) layer
 *
 *     This layer is part of the Management Entity. It allows applications
 *     to establish SCO connections and exchange audio data. SCO connections
 *     are derived from existing ACL (data) connections.
 *
 *     SCO-related events may be received by an application in two different
 *     ways: 1) All SCO-related events are sent to global handlers with
 *     appropriate masks (see ME_RegisterGlobalHandler). 2) An application
 *     must register an SCO handler (SCO_RegisterHandler) that
 *     receives only those SCO events that are associated with a certain
 *     ACL link.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SCO_CreateLink()
 *
 *     Creates an SCO (audio) connection to a remote device. An ACL
 *     link with the device must already be established.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     scocon - Receives a pointer to an SCO connection structure.  
 *
 *     remDev - pointer to remote device.  
 *
 *     types - For legacy SCO connection methods (before Bluetooth version 
 *         1.2), this parameter indicates the packet types allowed for the 
 *         connection.  Otherwise, this parameter is not used.  To set up 
 *         custom parameters for a SCO or an eSCO link, use SCO_SetupLink() 
 *         instead.  If your radio supports the Bluetooth 1.2 specification 
 *         or later, but you still want to use the older SCO connection 
 *         methods, be sure to define BT_SCO_USE_LEGACY_CONNECT as 
 *         XA_ENABLED.  
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - operation has been started successfully.  A 
 *         BTEVENT_SCO_CONNECT_CNF event will be sent to the SCO handler to 
 *         indicate the status of the SCO connection.  If the operation is 
 *         successful, then the error code will be BEC_NO_ERROR.  Other 
 *         codes indicate errors.  If the remote device attempts a SCO 
 *         connection generating an incoming connection at the same time, 
 *         the outgoing connection will fail with the error 
 *         BEC_LMP_TRANS_COLLISION or BEC_REQUEST_CANCELLED.  In this case, 
 *         the application should ignore the outgoing connection error and 
 *         accept the incoming connection to resolve the conflict.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - A SCO handler must be registered first.  See the 
 *         SCO_RegisterHandler function.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NO_RESOURCES - Too many SCO connections already in place
 *         (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - A parameter was invalid (XA_ERROR_CHECK
 *         only).

 * SCO_SetupLink()
 *
 *     Creates or modifies a SCO or eSCO connection to a remote device.  An 
 *     ACL link with the device must already be established.  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     scocon - In the case of a new connection, receives a pointer to a 
 *         SCO connection structure.  This value must be initialized to 0
 *         when establishing a new connection.  In the case of an existing
 *         eSCO connection to be modified, is the address of a pointer to an
 *         initialized SCO connection structure.
 *
 *     remDev - pointer to remote device.
 *
 *     scoTxParms - pointer to an initialized BtScoTxParms structure.  
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - operation has been started successfully.  A 
 *         BTEVENT_SCO_CONNECT_CNF event will be sent to the SCO handler to 
 *         indicate the status of a new eSCO connection.  A 
 *         BTEVENT_SCO_CONN_CHNG event will be sent to the SCO handler to 
 *         indicate the status of a modified eSCO connection.  If the 
 *         operation is successful then the error code will be 
 *         BEC_NO_ERROR.  Other codes indicate errors.  If the remote device 
 *         attempts a SCO connection generating an incoming connection at 
 *         the same time, the outgoing connection will fail with the error 
 *         BEC_LMP_TRANS_COLLISION or BEC_REQUEST_CANCELLED.  In this case,
