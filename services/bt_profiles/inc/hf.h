/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Hands-free SDK API layer
 *
 *     The Hands-free SDK is designed to create a hands-free application
 *     for Bluetooth.  It includes a complete implementation of the
 *     Hands-Free Profiles v1.5.  It also includes some features beyond the
 *     basic profiles that take advantage of features exported by many
 *     shipping phones.
 *
 *     The Hands-free SDK provides service discovery, connection management,
 *     call management, and basic phone book management.  It also allows for
 *     the transmission and reception of AT commands not specifically
 *     supported by Bluetooth profiles.
 *
 *     This SDK also includes an optional Call Manager component that tracks
 *     the state of calls in the audio gateway.  Many different events are
 *     generated to provide information about calls on the audio gateway.
 *     The Call Manager interprets these various events and translates them
 *     into a simplified event form.  The states of all calls are maintained
 *     within the Call Manager and can be queried by the application.  The
 *     Hands-Free code informs the Call Manager when events occur that could
 *     affect the call state.  The Call Manager makes intelligent decisions
 *     on which AT commands to send based on this information. The Call
 *     Manager will also use a polling method to keep the call state
 *     information up to date.

 *     registers the Hands-Free profile with the connection manager, RFCOMM,
 *     and SDP.  The application callback function is also bound to the
 *     channel.  This API will register a security record with default
 *     values using HF_SECURITY_SETTINGS.  To set the values in the security
 *     settings for the security record, it is better to use
 *     HF_RegisterSec() instead of HF_Register().
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     Chan - Contains a pointer to the channel structure that will be
 *         initialized and registered.
 *
 *     Callback - The application callback function that will receive
 *         events.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - The operation completed successfully.

 *     BT_STATUS_IN_USE - The operation failed because the channel has

 *
 * Returns:

 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specified channel has not been registered.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_BUSY - The operation failed because a service level

 *
 *     If an ACL link does not exist to the audio gateway, one will be
 *     created first.  If desired, however, the ACL link can be established

 *     Addr - The Bluetooth address of the remote device.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has started; the application will

 * HF_RegisterCmdOverride()
 *
 *     This function registers a callback function to be called any time the
 *     command state machine is called.
 *
 *     When an API function is called in the Hands-free SDK, the request is
 *     queued up to be executed when the channel becomes available.  When
 *     the channel is available for the next command on the queue, the
 *     command state machine is called repeatedly to allow the work of the
 *     logical command to be performed.  Each call the command state machine
 *     results in either an AT command being sent, or completion of a
 *     command.  Each time an AT command is sent and a response is received
 *     (OK, ERROR, CME ERROR, or a command timeout), the state machine is
 *     called again.  When the work of the logical command is completed, the
 *     command state machine completes the command and notifies the
 *     application.
 *
 *     This function allows the registration of a callback function that
 *     will be called each time the command state machine is called.  This
 *     allows an application to override the default behavior of an API
 *     call.  The callback function can determine which function call is
 *     being executed and set up its own AT commands for transmission.
 *
 *     When the override function sets up an AT command for transmission, it
 *     must return BT_STATUS_PENDING.  This indicates to the command state
 *     machine that it must send the AT command.  When the override function
 *     has completed its work, it must return BT_STATUS_SUCCESS.  This
 *     indicates to the command state machine that it must complete the
 *     command and notify the application (no AT command will be sent).  If
 *     the override function does not perform any work, it must return
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED to indicate to the command state machine that it
 *     must take the default action.
 *
 *     In order to use this feature properly, AT commands must be set up
 *     using the internal HfChannel structure field "atCommand."  This field
 *     is not normally a public field, but it can be accessed directly and
 *     is of the type AtCommandValues (see HF_SendAtCommand).  The override
 *     function must not send the AT command itself, but must rely on the
 *     command state machine to transmit the command.
 *
 *     In addition, the override function can look at the "state" field of
 *     the HfCommand structure to determine how many times the command state
 *     machine has been called for this particular command.  Each time the
 *     state machine is called, the "state" field is incremented.  Initially
 *     it will have the value of 0.  If multiple AT commands must be sent
 *     for a particular logical command, the "state" field will help to
 *     identify the command to send, or if the command is complete.
 *
 *     This feature adds a lot of power, but must be used properly as
 *     defined above in order for the internal states of the SDK to be
 *     maintained properly.
 *
 *     To unregister the callback, this function should be called with a
 *     NULL parameter.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     Callback - A pointer to the function that will be called.

 * HF_SetSniffExitPolicy()

 *     Policy - Bitmask that defines the policy for exiting sniff mode.
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - The policy was set successfully.

 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - Could not set the sniff policy, because
