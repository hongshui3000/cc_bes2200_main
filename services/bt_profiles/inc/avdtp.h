 * AVDTP API layer
 *
 *    Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol (AVDTP) is the 
 *    transport layer for the Generic Audio/Video Distribution 
 *    Profile defined by the Bluetooth Audio Video Working Group.  
 *    This protocol provides a mechanism for streaming Audio and 
 *    Video content over a wireless Bluetooth connection.  
 *
 *    The AVDTP API is designed for audio and video 
 *    applications using the BES Blue SDK core protocol stack.  
 *    It provides an API for connection management, stream discovery, 
 *    stream configuration and stream management.

 * AVDTP_StreamSendRawPacket()
 *
 *     Sends data on the specified stream.  The stream must be open and in 
 *     an active state.  No checking is done on the validity of 
 *     the data format.  Data is simply delivered to the stream raw.  It is 
 *     assumed that the data is properly formatted using the RTP media packet 
 *     format described in RFC1889.  It is further assumed that the payload 
 *     of the RTP media packet is in the proper format for the configured 
 *     stream.  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *     Stream - A registered and active AVDTP stream.  
 *
 *     Packet - An initialized BtPacket structure.  The Packet->data, 
 *         Packet->dataLen, Packet->headerLen, and Packet->flags fields must 
 *         be initialized.  Packet->headerLen must be 0, and Packet->flags 
 *         be set to BTP_FLAG_INUSE or BTP_FLAG_NONE.  The data 
 *         must be formatted as an RTP media packet defined by RFC1889.  
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The Write operation was started 
 *         successfully.  An AVDTP_EVENT_STREAM_PACKET_SENT event will be 
 *         received when the data has been sent.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - The stream is not in the active state.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - The Stream or Packet parameter does not 
 *         contain a valid pointer. (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specified channel or stream is not 
 *         registered.
