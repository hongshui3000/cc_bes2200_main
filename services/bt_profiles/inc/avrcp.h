/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AVRCP API layer
 *
 *     The Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) defines procedures for
 *     exchanging 1394 Trade Association AV/C commands between Bluetooth
 *     enabled Audio/Video devices. In addition, more advanced Bluetooth
 *     specific AV/C commands are available for exchanging media information
 *     and player settings.  Finally, if media browsing is supported (AVRCP
 *     1.4), AVRCP specific browsing commands can be exchanged. Internally,
 *     AVRCP uses the Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol (AVCTP) to
 *     exchange messages.
 *
 *     This API is designed to support AV remote control applications using
 *     the BES Blue SDK core protocol stack.  It provides an API
 *     for connection management and message handling.

 * AvrcpRole type
 *
 * Describes the roles supported by the device.  A device may have both
 * target and controller roles with various features sets.  These values may
 * be OR'd together to best describe the device.  The roles and features
 * defined here are included in the SDP database.  The actual functionality
 * of the API is not limited by the values chosen here.  A device is free to
 * play either role and send any command desired, regardless of the declared
 * roles and features.  It is up to the application to advertise its 
 * capabilities properly and provide the proper functionality.
 *
 * Typically, an audio sink will support AVRCP_CT_CATEGORY_1 (play control)
 * and AVRCP_TG_CATEGORY_2 (volume control), while an audio source will support
 * AVRCP_TG_CATEGORY_1 and AVRCP_CT_CATEGORY_2 (see AVRCP_CT and AVRCP_TG).  
 * It is important to note that a device that includes volume control is both
 * a controller and a target.  An audio sink will be a controller for most 
 * functions, but a target for volume control.  The reverse is true for an
 * audio source.  The API does not restrict the sending of any command or
 * response, regardless of the roles defined, so it is important that the
 * application only send the appropriate commands/responses.
 *
 * For AVRCP 1.3 or later devices, other advanced features that are implemented 
 * by the application can be declared here as well.  For devices supporting 
 * AVRCP 1.3 or earlier, the "browsing" feature is not supported.
 * Devices that support advanced features, such as Player Settings and Group
 * Navigation, must have the features enabled in the build (see 
 * AVRCP_ADVANCED_CONTROLLER and AVRCP_ADVANCED_TARGET).

 * AVRCP_RejectPanelOperation()
 *
 *     Rejects a panel operation received from the connected 
 *     controller. This function must be called during 
 *     notification of the AVRCP_EVENT_PANEL_IND event. Further notifications 
 *     corresponding to the operation (AVRCP_PS_HOLD, AVRCP_PS_RELEASE) 
 *     will not be received.  
 *
 *     If this function is not called during the AVRCP_EVENT_PANEL_IND 
 *     the operation is automatically "ACCEPTED".  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     chnl - A registered and open AVRCP channel.  
 *
 *     rsp - Response code. Must be one of AVRCP_RESPONSE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED 
 *         or AVRCP_RESPONSE_REJECTED. Note that REJECTED is only used 
 *         when the operation is already reserved by another controller.  
 *         This response code does NOT indicate the result of the 
 *         operation itself (for example, a PLAY command when no media 
 *         is available should be accepted, but simply have no effect).  
 *
 * Returns:
 *     None

 * 
 * Parameters:
 * 
 *     chnl - A registered and open AVRCP channel.  
 *
 *     pdu - A PDU for sending a browse command.
 * 
 *     uidCounter - The UID count reported from the target.
 * 
 *     uid - The UID of the item.
 * 
 *     scope - The scope on the virtual file system.
 * 
 *     numAttrs - The number of attributes being requested.  If 0 is
 *                specified, then all attributes will be returned.
 * 
 *     attrList - The list of attributes being requested.  If numAttrs is 0,
 *                then this value can be NULL.
 * 
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has been started 
 *         successfully. When the associated packet has been sent, 
 *         the application callback will receive the
 *         AVRCP_EVENT_BROWSE_TX_DONE event.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_IN_USE - The 'cmd' packet was in use and cannot be sent.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - The operation failed, because the 
 *         chnl or cmd parameter is invalid.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND - The specified channel is not registered.
