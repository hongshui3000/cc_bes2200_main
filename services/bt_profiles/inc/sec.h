 ****************************************************************************/


/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SEC_RegisterPairingHandler()
 *
 *     Register the handler that will handle all user interactions for
 *     pairing.  This handler is called when user interaction is required. 
 *     When both devices support Secure Simple Pairing, this handler is called
 *     when "Man In The Middle" protection is required, and an
 *     authenticated link key will be generated.  If "Just Works" pairing
 *     occurs no user interaction is required.  When one of the devices does
 *     not support Secure Simple Pairing, this handler will be called
 *     whenever a PIN code exchanges is required.
 *
 *     If no handler is set (handler == 0) then the pairing
 *     procedure will fail. This function is used to set pairable
 *     mode. The old handler is returned when the function is 
 *     called.
 *
 *     The pairing handler is called with the following events:
 *
 *     BTEVENT_PIN_REQ - If "errCode" is BEC_NO_ERROR, this event
 *     indicates a PIN code is needed. The handler provides a PIN
 *     code by calling SEC_SetPin. If "errCode" is NOT BEC_NO_ERROR,
 *     this event indicates a previous PIN code request has
 *     been cancelled.
 *
 *     BTEVENT_PASS_KEY_REQ - If "errCode" is BEC_NO_ERROR, this event
 *     indicates a Passkey  is needed. The handler provides a Passkey by 
 *     calling SEC_SetPassKey. If "errCode" is NOT BEC_NO_ERROR,
 *     this event indicates a previous Passkey request has
 *     been cancelled.
 *
 *     BTEVENT_CONFIRM_NUMERIC_REQ - If "errCode" is BEC_NO_ERROR, this event
 *     indicates that a user confirmation is needed. The handler provides this
 *     confirmation by calling SEC_UserConfirm.  If "errCode" is NOT BEC_NO_ERROR,
 *     this event indicates a previous confirmation request has been cancelled.
 *
 *     BTEVENT_DISPLAY_NUMERIC_IND - If "errCode" is BEC_NO_ERROR, this event
 *     indicates that a numeric value must be displayed.  No confirmation of 
 *     this event is required by the handler.  If "errCode" is NOT BEC_NO_ERROR,
 *     this event indicates a previous request has been cancelled.
 *
 *     BTEVENT_PAIRING_COMPLETE - This event indicates that pairing
 *     has completed successfully and the link is authenticated.
 *     The "errCode" field of the BtEvent indicates the status of
 *     storing the link key. If pairing fails no event will be 
 *     sent (there is no event sent by the radio module indicating 
 *     failure).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     handler - pointer to the handler for dealing with pairing.
 *         This handler can be a registered global handler but does
 *         not have to be.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     Pointer to the old handler.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SEC_RegisterAuthorizeHandler()
 *
 *     Register the handler that will handle all authorization.  
 *     This handler is called when authorization is needed.  
 *
 *     If no handler is set (handler == 0) then the authorization
 *     procedure will fail. 
 *
 *     The authorization handler is called with the following events:
 *
 *     BTEVENT_AUTHORIZATION_REQ - If "errCode" is BEC_NO_ERROR, this event
 *     indicates a request for authorization. The link needing authorization
 *     is passed in the "remDev" field of BtEvent. During the callback, the
 *     handler can call SEC_GetSecurityRecord to obtain more information on
 *     what service or channel is being authorized. If "errCode" is NOT
 *     BEC_NO_ERROR, this event indicates a previous authorization request
 *     has been cancelled.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     handler - pointer to the handler for dealing with 
 *         authorization.  This handler can be a registered global 
 *         handler or even the same handler that does pairing but it
 *         does not have to be.

 *
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The operation has started. The results

 * SEC_EnumDeviceRecords()
 *
 *     Enumerate the device database. The first record is at index 0. The
 *     intent of this function is to enumerate all records in the device
 *     database in a loop. If records are added or deleted in between calls
 *     to this function then all records may not be returned or duplicate
 *     records could be returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     i - index of desired record. The first record is at index 0.
 *
 *     record - pointer to location to receive record.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - operation is successful. 
 *         Record is returned
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_FAILED - operation failed. No record is
 *         returned. This occurs if the index is greater than
 *         the number of records or an error occurred in reading
 *         the database.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - operation failed because record
 *         is invalid (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).
