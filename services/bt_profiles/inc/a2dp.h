 * A2DP API layer
 *
 *     Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) is the Profile 
 *     defined by the Bluetooth Audio Video Working Group for 
 *     streaming audio content over a Bluetooth connection.  
 *
 *     The A2DP API is designed for audio applications using the 
 *     BES Blue SDK core protocol stack.  It provides functions 
 *     for connection management, audio stream discovery, audio stream
 *     management, and security.
 *
 *     Applications that use the A2DP API will also require knowledge of 
 *     certain AVDTP (Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol) types as 
 *     referenced by this API.  Although some AVDTP data structures are 
 *     used by A2DP, applications should use either the AVDTP API or 
 *     the A2DP API and not mix the two.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A2DP_OpenStream()
 *
 *    Searches for and begins to open a stream on the remote device.  This 
 *    function searches for a stream with capabilities matching those that 
 *    were registered using A2DP_Register() and 
 *    A2DP_AddContentProtection().  As streams are discovered, the 
 *    application is notified of matching capability types through the 
 *    A2DP_EVENT_CODEC_INFO and A2DP_EVENT_CP_INFO events.  The application 
 *    can cache or verify the specific elements of these capabilities.  When 
 *    all matching capabilities have been discovered, the application is 
 *    notified through the A2DP_EVENT_GET_CONFIG_IND event.  When this event 
 *    is received, the application must call A2DP_SetStreamConfig().  The 
 *    connection progress will not continue until the stream has been 
 *    configured. Once configured, the application will receive the 
 *    A2DP_STREAM_OPEN event.  When this event has been received with no 
 *    errors, the stream is open.  If no streams with matching capabilities 
 *    can be found, the stream is closed.  
 *
 *    A2DP_AbortStream() can be called to close the stream to abort this 
 *    process if necessary.  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *     Stream - A registered and configured A2DP stream.  
 *
 *     Addr - The Bluetooth address of the device to which the connection 
 *            should be made.  If Addr is 0, then a device inquiry will be 
 *            initiated.  A Device Monitor handler must be registered to 
 *            receive events and to select the desired device.  It is only 
 *            possible to use and value of 0 for Addr if connecting to a 
 *            device that is not already connected.  If the device was 
 *            already connected, an attempt to connect again will fail.  To 
 *            establish a new stream to an already connected device, the 
 *            BD_ADDR of the connected device must be used in the Addr 
 *            parameter.  
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - The Open Stream operation was started 
 *         successfully.  Codec and Content Protection events will be 
 *         received if a stream is discovered.  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_INVALID_PARM - The 'Stream', or 'Cp' parameter does not 
 *         contain a valid pointer. (XA_ERROR_CHECK only).  
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_IN_USE - The specified stream is already in use.
 * 
 *     BT_STATUS_BUSY - A search is already in progress.

 * A2DP_StreamIncrementTimeStamp()
 *
 *     Increments the timestamp for the SBC stream.  This function should be

 *     (due to a lack of resources, for example).  Each SBC packet has a 
 *     timestamp associated with it when it is sent, so when PCM data cannot 
 *     be sent, the timestamp needs to be adjusted to account for the lost 
 *     audio data.  The amount of the adjustment is obtained from the number 
 *     of samples in the PCM data block.  
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *     Stream - A registered and active A2DP stream.  
 *
 *     Packet - An initialized SbcPacket structure with valid SBC data.  The 
 *         data, datalen, and FrameSize fields must be initialized.

 *         Sampling frequencies - Must support 48000 or 44100.  
 *         Channel mode - Must support MONO and one other mode.  
 *         Block length - Must support all block lengths.  
 *         Subbands - Must support 8 subbands.  
 *         Allocation Method - must support LOUDNESS.
