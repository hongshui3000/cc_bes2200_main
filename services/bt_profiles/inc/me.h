 *     handlers will receive BTEVENT_LINK_CONNECT_CNF as will the handler

 *
 *     If connections already exist to other devices, then ME will attempt
 *     to put all other connections on hold, then begin a connection
 *     to the specified device.
 *
 *     If a connection already exists to the device indicated by bdAddr,
 *     this function will register the handler with the BtRemoteDevice
 *     and return BT_STATUS_SUCCESS immediately. In this way, many local
 *     handlers can be registered to the same connection. Be aware that
 *     ME_DisconnectLink will not take effect until it is called for
 *     ALL registered handlers of the BtRemoteDevice. To determine whether
 *     a connection already exists without registering a handler,
 *     use ME_FindRemoteDevice instead.
 *
 *     A slave device does not need to use this API unless it needs
 *     to register a local handler or initiate a disconnection of the link
 *     (see ME_DisconnectLink).
 *
 *     The type of connection created to the remote device uses
 *     the quality of service parameters necessary for the RFCOMM
 *     based profiles or profiles requiring reliable, non
 *     real-time critical links. For other types of connections, use
 *     ME_CreateRestrictedLink.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     handler - pointer to an unregistered handler to receive
 *         events. This handler cannot be the global handler though
 *         they both can point to the same callback. The handler
 *         must be initialized using ME_InitHandler. The handler
 *         is in use until the link is disconnected and should not
 *         be modified while in use.
 *
 *     bdAddr - pointer to address of remote device.
 *
 *     psi - pointer to page scan information obtained during
 *         Inquiry. Initial links to a device should set this parameter
 *         to ensure a reliable connection. If the psi is not known, a
 *         default "psi" of 0 on an initial link will use clockOffset = 0,
 *         psMode = 0, and psRepMode = 1. If a client is binding to an
 *         existing remote device, then "psi" can be set to 0.
 *
 *     remDev - pointer to memory to receive remote device pointer.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - operation has started successfully
 *         result will be sent to handler.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - client is successfully bound to the remote device.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_RESTRICTED - the operation failed because this remote

 * ME_SetAccessibleModeNC()
 *
 *     Set the accessibility mode when the device is not
 *     connected. If the mode is set to a value other than
 *     BAM_NOT_ACCESSIBLE and there are no connections then the
 *     Bluetooth radio will enter inquiry and/or page scan mode
 *     using the information passed in info. If info is 0 or the
 *     values in info are set to defaults (BT_DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL
 *     and BT_DEFAULT_SCAN_WINDOW) the radio module default values
 *     are used. It is assumed that the macro defaults
 *     match the radio defaults (see BT_DEFAULT_PAGE_SCAN_WINDOW
 *     documentation.) So, the first call to ME_SetAccessibleModeNC
 *     with info set to 0 will not change the settings as the radio has
 *     already been initialized to its default settings. If there is
 *     a connection or a connection is in the process  of being created
 *     then mode and info are saved and applied when all connections are
 *     disconnected.
 *
 *     To keep other devices from finding and connecting to this
 *     device set the mode to BAM_NOT_ACCESSIBLE. The default mode when
 *     the stack is first loaded and initialized is controlled by
 *     BT_DEFAULT_ACCESS_MODE_NC.
 *
 *     In setting the values for info. Both "inqWindow" and
 *     "inqInterval" must be set to defaults or to legitimate
 *     values. The range for values is 0x0012 to 0x1000. The time
 *     calculated by taking the value * 0.625ms. It is an error
 *     if one is a default and the other is not. This is also true
 *     for "pageInterval" and "pageWindow".
 *
 *     Any time the scan interval or window is different from
 *     the current settings in the radio, the radio will be
 *     instructed to change to the new settings. This means that
 *     if there are different settings for the connected state
 *     versus the non-connected state, the radio module will be
 *     instructed to change the settings when the first connection
 *     comes up and when the last connection goes down
 *     (automatically). This also means that if different values
 *     for window and interval are set when going from any setting
 *     of accessible to non-accessible then the radio will be
 *     instructed to change. In most cases it is best to use
 *     the radio defaults. In this way the radio is never told
 *     to change the scan interval or window.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     mode - desired accessibility mode
 *
 *     info - pointer to structure containing the inquiry and page
 *         scan interval and window to use. If info is 0 then the
 *         defaults set by the radio module are used.

 * ME_SetAccessibleModeC()
 *
 *     Set the accessibility mode to be used when the device is
 *     connected to one or more devices. If the mode is set to a
 *     value other than BAM_NOT_ACCESSIBLE and there is a
 *     connection to one or more devices then the Bluetooth radio
 *     will enter inquiry and/or page scan mode using the
 *     information passed in info. If info is 0 or the values in
 *     info are set to defaults (BT_DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL and
 *     BT_DEFAULT_SCAN_WINDOW) the radio module default values
 *     are used. It is assumed that the macro defaults
 *     match the radio defaults (see BT_DEFAULT_PAGE_SCAN_WINDOW
 *     documentation.) So, the first call to ME_SetAccessibleModeC
 *     with info set to 0 will not change the settings as the radio has
 *     already been initialized to its default settings. If there are
 *     no active connections then mode and info are saved and applied
 *     when the first connection comes up.
 *
 *     To keep other devices from finding and connecting to this
 *     device when connected set the mode to BAM_NOT_ACCESSIBLE.
 *     The default mode when the stack is first loaded and initialized
 *     is controlled by BT_DEFAULT_ACCESS_MODE_C.
 *
 *     In setting the values for info. Both "inqWindow" and
 *     "inqInterval" must be set to defaults or to legitimate
 *     values. The range for values is 0x0012 to 0x1000. The time
 *     is calculated by taking the value * 0.625ms. It is an error
 *     if one field (interval/window) is a default and the other is
 *     not. This also true for "pageInterval" and "pageWindow".
 *
 *     Any time the scan interval or window is different from
 *     the current settings in the radio, the radio will be
 *     instructed to change to the new settings. This means that
 *     if there are different settings for the connected state
 *     versus the non-connected state, the radio module will be
 *     instructed to change the settings when the first connection
 *     comes up and when the last connection goes down
 *     (automatically). This also means that if different values
 *     for window and interval are set when going from any setting
 *     of accessible to non-accessible then the radio will be
 *     instructed to change. In most cases it is best to use
 *     the radio defaults. In this way the radio is never told
 *     to change the scan interval or window.
 *
 * Requires:
 *     BT_ALLOW_SCAN_WHILE_CON enabled.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     mode - desired accessibility mode
 *
 *     info - pointer to structure containing the inquiry and page
 *         scan interval and window to use. If info is 0 then the
 *         defaults set by the radio module are used.

 *         actually takes affect or an error has occurred. The "errCode"
 *         field of the BtEvent indicates the status of the operation.
 *         If the operation is successful the "aMode" field of BtEvent

 *         is complete.
 *
 *         "token.p.general.in.event" must contain the event that is expected

 *
 *     Sets the channel classification for Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH.)
 *     Each of the 79 1-MHz channels in the Bluetooth 2.4-GHz band may be
 *     marked bad or unknown. The AFH controller will not use channels
 *     marked bad. The AFH controller will evaluate for use any channels
 *     marked unknown (if automatic classification mode is enabled.) Bad
 *     channels are indicated with a 0 value. Unknown channels are
 *     indicated with a 1 value in the bit-mask.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     channelClass - 79 1-bit fields in a 10-byte array, indicating channels
 *         marked bad or unknown. The nth field (0 - 78) indicates the value
 *         for channel n. Bit 79 is unused and must be 0.
 *
 *     autoMode - Boolean value indicating whether the controller should
 *         automatically determine channel classification for the channels
 *         marked unknown.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - the channel classification has been sent to the
 *         controller.
 *
 *     BT_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS - another ME_SetChannelClassification operation
 *         is currently in progress. Try again later.

 * ME_RadioInit()
 *
 *     Called to initialize the radio module, including the HCI

 *     necessary (ME_RadioShutdown() has been called).  When initialization
 *     is successful, the BTEVENT_HCI_INITIALIZED event will be received.
 *
 * Parameters:  void
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STATUS_SUCCESS - Initialization was successful.  The application will
 *         be notified during the call that initialization is complete with
 *         BTEVENT_HCI_INITIALIZED.

 *     BT_STATUS_PENDING - Initialization was started successfully.  The
 *         application will be notified when initialization is complete.  If

 *     requirements for the packet size, and often radios do not
 *     advertise the appropriate size.  In addition, the size should
 *     be changed if multiple SCO channels are used.  This function should

 *
 *     Example USB packet sizes:
 *
 *     16 bit audio:  Each SCO channel requires 48 byte packets.
 *     8  bit audio:  Each SCO channel requires 24 byte packets.
